### ESLint in Visual Studio Code
Having not known about ESLint until this past week, using it for the first time was an interesting experience. It was a bit difficult to install at first, but it does add useful comments that keep your code layout consistent. Even little things such as the amount of spaces, where brackets are located, and so forth help make the code easier to understand. The most commonly used commands are also fairly similar and intuitive for those who have ever used Terminal or Unix to compile files. In addition, having used Eclipse IDE for practicing JavaScript and formatting my code to a certain standard, I am also familiar with keeping my code to a more rigid layout. However, also similarly to Eclipse, I found myself wondering...

### Are Coding Standards Overly Complicated?
For the most part, I would say no. Keeping to a homogenous coding standard is like keeping to a specific form of writing when creating an essay; it makes your writing easier to comprehend overall and gives it a consistent voice. While it is not essential to the syntax (or purpose) of the writing itself, having an established coding standard and sticking to it makes the work feel more professional and put-together overall.

One of the problems I have with some of these softwares, however, is that sometimes they don't tell you why your code should be formatted a certain way. Often times it will just underline your code in red, give you an error number, or just tell you the code needs to be changed, but it will never tell you why. As a result, I don't understand what I'm doing to fix my code, I'm just trying to get rid of all the errors.

### Conclusion
Therefore, I would say that while using ESLint was an overall positive experience, what the software flags and how to properly use it can use some improvement. Especially for a first-time user, ESLint getting the software to work and how to take advantage of its capabilities was not an easy concept to understand. It did make coding a bit easier, and it does help you understand the language a bit better; however, like most tools there is room for improvement.
