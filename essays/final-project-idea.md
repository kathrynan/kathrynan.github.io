### Overview

*The problem*: For many university students, their first introduction to the gym is the Rec Center. They want to be more active but are too intimidated to go to the gym alone. They are discouraged by their lack of experience and knowledge of the machines and fear making mistakes and injuring themselves, or they feel more motivated when they are with others. To overcome this, they opt to invite their friends to come along with them. But oftentimes, their schedules don’t match up, which deters them from going. 

*The solution*: This gym buddy app allows students to meet up according to their schedules and workout preferences and go to the gym together. With this, UH students can potentially meet people with similar interests and experience levels and not be afraid of going to the gym alone.

### Mockup Page Ideas
- Homepage (About, Login/Signup)
- User profile page and profile setup
  - Input gender, years of experience, schedule, split, height, personal records, contact info
- Other users’ profile page
  - View user’s gender, years of experience, schedule, split, height, personal records, contact info
  - View comparisons between their profile and yours
- Explore page
  - List of other gym goers on the site
  - Indicators of whose schedules match with yours
- Admin settings page
  - Create/Edit/Delete user data

### Use Case Ideas
- New user enters homepage, creates an account, sets up profile, goes to explore page, views a user’s profile, gets contact info and contacts them
- User enters homepage, logs in, goes to explore page, views a user’s profile, gets contact info and contacts them
- User enters homepage, logs in, goes to profile page, updates profile
- Admin enters landing page, logs in, gets redirected to homepage, goes to admin settings, edits data (profiles)

### Beyond the Basics

Besides the aforementioned functions, some more advanced features that would be useful to implement are as follows:
- Saving individual user customizations to a database (school ID / school accounts)
- Simple messaging system
   - Limited features for scheduling meetups at the gym (not an actual messenger)
- A feature recommending potential gym partners (based off of experience / amount of weight they can lift)
