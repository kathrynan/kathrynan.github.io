When it comes to group project work, no matter how bad the situation gets, I have managed to squeeze a decent result out of it. Thankfully, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with some wonderful peers that really know their stuff. The final project we worked on, titled Gym Buddy, is a website I personally feel very proud of, and makes me amazed at how great of coders my teammates are. However, there was one aspect of the project that I was particularly nervous about: the effort estimation and tracking. Its purpose was to ensure that we were all working on the project and for how long.

I made my effort estimates based on how confident I was at the specific task, as well as how much coding effort it would take. I knew that coding would take a lot more time and effort than just writing, even if I was confident I knew how to code the task in. I gave myself at least an hour if I knew I had to code something, and I based my estimates off of what and how much I needed to write.
