### Initial Remarks

At first, I was quite intimidated going into a class called "software engineering". I had no idea how much "engineering" terminology or skills I was supposed to have, and I feel quite weak in mathematical areas of computer science. Needless to say, I wasn't sure how well I was going to do. Thankfully, after a few weeks of seeing what the routine would be like, I found myself enjoying a lot of the skills we were learning in class.
