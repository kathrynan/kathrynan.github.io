### Initial Remarks

At first, I was quite intimidated going into a class called "software engineering". I had no idea how much "engineering" terminology or skills I was supposed to have, and I feel quite weak in mathematical areas of computer science. Needless to say, I wasn't sure how well I was going to do. Thankfully, after a few weeks of seeing what the routine would be like, I found myself enjoying a lot of the skills we were learning in class.

### What I Learned

The most enjoyable aspects I have from class were the design aspects of software engineering, both with the product and the actual coding process itself. Coding standards was something that I feel we didn't touch on a lot, but really liked learning about. To give context, coding standards are sets of guidelines and practices that make writing code more consistent and easier to read. I am an officer of the Game Dev Club on campus, and I've seen that a lot of the issues the coding directors run into with new programmers is their code is often difficult to understand and/or disorganized. I thought that most people have an organized way of writing code, but now I see how important it is for collaborative projects especially. Even if they don't understand all the tips and tricks to make their code consistent, following simple coding standard practices helps readability immensely. Incorporating some sort of coding standard and teaching it to new members is already in the works, and I hope to see that the collaborative coding within the club becomes easier over time.

Another concept I really enjoyed learning about was user interface framework (UI framework), because of how easy and convenient it is to make something look really good and easy to use with very little effort. UI frameworks are essentially libraries of commands, tags, and code that serve some purpose within a UI such as buttons, menu options, and so forth. One of the first ones we ended up learning about in class, Bootstrap, was so fun to learn because of its compatability with HTML (one of the first web languages I learned). Similarly to my last point, I can really see this being implemented in certain games I would end up developing, specifically ones with a lot of menu options. Having libraries to pull these pre-made components from opens up a lot more opportunities to get creative with projects, which is something I find a lot of fun in.

### Conclusion

I'm quite happy with what I accomplished in this class, but I honestly wish I had more time to focus on specific points and learn more concepts. The semester was very difficult, but I'm glad I was able to learn so much. I hope to continue learning outside of the class and developing my software engineering skills even further.
