### Introduction

With the exponential growth in technology over the past several decades, it's no wonder that AI is the next up-and-coming, rising star that's shaking the world. Disregarding the many controversies surrounding AI for the sake of this essay, AI is changing the education and software engineering sphere for better or worse. AI is already being used as another search engine that answers your questions, and students are using it to help complete their homework (and exams). While the technology behind AI isn't perfect, and the information it provides is not always correct, schools around the world are attempting to adapt quickly with the inevitable rise and improvement of AI.

Software engineering, in a similar vein, has been made more.. accessible due to the use of AI. It can create code from prompts, find and fix errors without you needing to look through your work, and switch/transcribe code between different programming languages. It's such a useful tool, but also a temptation that is hard to resist. To share some of my personal experience in my software engineering class specifically, I normally use AI when it comes to solving bugs. With the assignments becoming more lengthy and complicated, having AI go through the work and finding the problem code is a time (and life) saver. In the beginning it was ChatGPT, as that was the only one known to me, but around halfway through I switched to Copilot since it occasionally gave more in-depth explanations.


### Personal Experience with AI

This section will be written with the purpose of reflecting on the past few months to see how AI has affected my understanding and learning in my software engineering class. The explanations and experiences will be strictly about this class (ICS314), and the examples will reflect as such.

#### WODs

First are the expereince WODs, which were mainly homework assignments. When it comes to the homework, I preferred to not use AI unless I was stuck on a problem. Since I did not get docked points for taking a long time, I would focus more on learning and understanding the material. For in-class practice WODs, I did not use AI since they weren't really timed or graded in the same way as the regular WODs. The main focus of the practice WODs were exactly that: to practice. As a result, I refrained from using them any time I participated in the practice WODs. In-class WODs, on the other hand, were a different story. These weekly quizzes were some of the most stressful aspects of the class, especially as the WODs grew increasingly more difficult. At first, I made the choice to not use AI at all. It was easier to do when the WODs were simpler, but as the semester went on, I felt like I was lagging behind in time and quality without using AI. I mainly used it to correct bugs or ask it what functions I could use when I forgot, which helped take away some of the stress.

#### Essays and Final Project

When it came to writing essays, I feel no need to use AI for any writing or grammer-related purposes. Writing comes very naturally to me, and I feel very proficient in it that I don't need AI to supplement my work. For the final project, excluding a lot of the UI work, I used a lot of tutorial videos and AI to help make sure everything ran properly. Working with a team meant that there were a lot of files that I didn't make or contribute to, so ensuring I didn't do anything to create errors would've been difficult without using AI. For example, I helped to work on the explore page of our website, and although it isn't quite complete, I wouldn't have gotten that far if it weren't for AI. There were so many files in the final stage of development that I needed to use Copilot to show me how to implement what I needed without messing up other people's work.

#### Learning / Coding

Due to the amount of materials provided/recommended in the class, I didn't really need AI to help me learn new concepts. Even if there was something I didn't understand, Google would often have the answer. If Google didn't have it, however, then AI helped explain concepts step-by-step, which made it really easy to digest mentally. For example, FreeCodeCamp was a website we used a lot during our UI sections of the class. It's a great resource for learning specific concepts, so I didn't need to use AI at all during those few weeks.

A part of the process when it comes to learning what certain code does, for me, is being able to articulate its function, even if it's just in my head. As a result, when it comes to explaining or documenting code, I hardly needed to use AI at all. Writing and quality assurance testing is a different story, as often times I wouldn't know what was wrong with the code or how I could perform a certain task, and I would ask ChatGPT to help me get started or look over my code. When providing a coding example, it depends on how complicated the concept is and how much base knowledge the person I'm explaining it to has. Often times, I would ask ChatGPT to *write* an example so that I could explain it better, instead of using vague concepts in the hopes they understand.

#### Asking & Answering Questions

Unfortunately, I didn't really ask or answer a lot of questions in the discord, so I can't say whether or not I would have used AI for this area. A lot of the questions I had were answered via Google or forum posts, so I never posted questions to the discord channel.


### Impact on Learning & Understanding

I am very aware that AI hinders my ability to retain and fully comprehend learned information/skills. Often times, I just need to "bash my head against the wall" until I get it, but AI is too convenient and allows me to search up the answer almost immediately. While it does help in a pinch, in the long term I would much rather take more time to learn every subject than speed through using AI.


### Practical Applications

The world of AI is still very new to me, and I haven't dabbled in it much personally, so I don't really have a lot of practical applications that come to mind. AI, when it comes to creativity, is very limited in its capabiltiies as it can only generate something from previously fed information or concepts. It can not come up with new, innovative ideas that a human could. As a lot of my interests stem in more creative spheres such as game development or UI design, the most I think AI could do would be to have pre-set designs that it tweaks depending on the user's wants. Personally, I would much rather have a human developing the games I play and create the designs I'm looking at.


### Challenges & Opportunities

As mentioned in the previous section, AI does have a lot of limitations at the moment; however, when it comes to software engineering, it's one of the more proficient areas AI can work in. There is an aspect of the development side in which AI would not help as much, but I felt like that aspect of the class was meant to be more creative and loose. This was especially so when we created React, Bootstrap, and other versions of a website of our choosing. We had to work within the appearance of the original website, but trying to figure out how to make things match in appearance was very fun, in my opinion.

I'm not sure how much more AI can be integrated into this software engineering course, as it's able to be used in almost every aspect of the class. Perhaps it can be used to provide more examples of how code can be written to produce a similar/the same outcome, therefore showing multiple ways students can solve a problem.


### Comparative Analysis

I am not entirely sure what the original teaching methods for software engineering were, as I've only begun learning about programming recently. If I were to make an assumption, I would say that, compared to how it's taught now, software engineering would be a much more tedious skill to learn. Like all programming-related fields, it requires a lot of patience to not only understand how to write code but fix errors when you come across them. How software engineering is taught now seems a bit more reliant on computers/AI to autofill or catch errors as you're working, making the process a lot easier on the programmer. I believe that the learning curve involves the student doing a lot of trial and error, gaining experience by making mistakes and trying to fix the problem themselves (as opposed to searching up the answer). Therefore, I would say that AI does not help when it comes to knowledge retention, practical skill development, or engagement, as it easily hands you the answer without you having to work for it.


### Future Considerations & Conclusion

As I'd stated in the beginning, for better or for worse, AI will remain a permanent aspect of software engineering and programming in general. It is a very useful tool that makes the process of programming faster and less infuriating, allowing for the user to focus on the content itself. This can also lead to education leaning more towards innovation and creativity, once the essential mechanics have been taught. However, students who want to learn software engineering should be extremely careful about AI becoming a crutch they have to rely on. Learning how to problem solve and think critically are necessary skills people often take for granted.

AI is a great tool to explain and teach you how to do things, so I hope AI is used and trained with that purpose in mind. Since the software engineering course does not have a lot of artistically-inclined projects, I personally don't think the use of AI in class is that bad. What matters is to what extent it's used, and if the students are willing to put in the effort to learn themselves and not use AI as an "easy A". Said students will be extremely underprepared in future upper-level courses, which won't prove useful to anybody. I have no recommendations, only a word of caution: the easy path is often the longest, because on the road to a quick degree is a student who hasn't worked to get where they are, and will soon realize their shortcomings when they stand next to a student with integrity and passion for learning.
