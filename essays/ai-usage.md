### Introduction

With the exponential growth in technology over the past several decades, it's no wonder that AI is the next up-and-coming, rising star that's shaking the world. Disregarding the many controversies surrounding AI for the sake of this essay, AI is changing the education and software engineering sphere for better or worse. AI is already being used as another search engine that answers your questions, and students are using it to help complete their homework (and exams). While the technology behind AI isn't perfect, and the information it provides is not always correct, schools around the world are attempting to adapt quickly with the inevitable rise and improvement of AI.

Software engineering, in a similar vein, has been made more.. accessible due to the use of AI. It can create code from prompts, find and fix errors without you needing to look through your work, and switch/transcribe code between different programming languages. It's such a useful tool, but also a temptation that is hard to resist. To share some of my personal experience in my software engineering class specifically, I normally use AI when it comes to solving bugs. With the assignments becoming more lengthy and complicated, having AI go through the work and finding the problem code is a time (and life) saver. In the beginning it was ChatGPT, as that was the only one known to me, but around halfway through I switched to Copilot since it occasionally gave more in-depth explanations.

### Personal Experience with AI

This section will be written with the purpose of reflecting on the past few months to see how AI has affected my understanding and learning in my software engineering class. The explanations and experiences will be strictly about this class (ICS314), and the examples will reflect as such.

#### WODs

First are the expereince WODs, which were mainly homework assignments. When it comes to the homework, I preferred to not use AI unless I was stuck on a problem. Since I did not get docked points for taking a long time, I would focus more on learning and understanding the material. For in-class practice WODs, I did not use AI since they weren't really timed or graded in the same way as the regular WODs. The main focus of the practice WODs were exactly that: to practice. As a result, I refrained from using them any time I participated in the practice WODs. In-class WODs, on the other hand, were a different story. These weekly quizzes were some of the most stressful aspects of the class, especially as the WODs grew increasingly more difficult. At first, I made the choice to not use AI at all. It was easier to do when the WODs were simpler, but as the semester went on, I felt like I was lagging behind in time and quality without using AI. I mainly used it to correct bugs or ask it what functions I could use when I forgot, which helped take away some of the stress.
