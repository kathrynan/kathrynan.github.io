### Making Effort Estimates

When it comes to group project work, no matter how bad the situation gets, I have managed to squeeze a decent result out of it. This time I’ve had the privilege of working with some wonderful peers, so the result, I feel, very much exceeded decent. The final project we worked on, titled Gym Buddy, is a website where students can register to find other students to befriend and go to the campus center gym with, and after seeing how much was needed to make this site a success, I am beyond amazed at how great of coders my teammates are. There was one aspect of the project, however, that I was particularly nervous about: the effort estimation and tracking. Its purpose was to ensure that we were all working on the project and keep track as to how long we worked on a singular task.

I made my effort estimates based on how confident I was at each task, as well as how much coding effort it would take. I knew that coding would take a lot more time and effort than just writing, even if I was confident I knew how to code the task I was given. I gave myself at least an hour if I knew I had to code something, and I based my estimates off of what and how much I needed to write.

### How It Affected the Process

I did not see any immediate benefits to making effort estimates in advance, since I would either be writing and not focusing on the time, or constantly worrying over how much time had passed and not actually focusing on writing/fixing the code. This applies to the WODs as well, but I already know I do better when there isn’t any kind of time constraint or deadline looming over my coding. It allows me to focus more on problem solving rather than making and fixing something within a time limit.

When it came to keeping track of my actual effort, I would make it easy for myself. For example, if I was in class, I spent all the time on one specific task so I knew exactly how much time was spent. When I was at home or just working outside of class, I would start and stop at round minutes such as 10:30, 11:00, or even 2:45. However, I knew that we’d be tracking our time per hour, so I tried to keep it as simple as possible. The spreadsheets we’d use, on the other hand, would track our time in minutes (for some reason), so I would go into more detail there. I believe my tracking was fairly accurate but, of course, if I used a timer with more detailed seconds or minutes, it would be better (albeit more stressful).

### My Personal Thoughts

There wasn’t much overhead when it came to my tracking in general. Taking time to note down how long it’s been was not much of a hassle, but I feel like it did put me in a worse mindset before I even started the task: I had to meet the expectations I was setting by a certain time frame. It is, though, an important mindset. I imagine if I’m given a coding task at work, or a project I need to finish by a certain deadline, the customer would want someone who could work efficiently. When it came to the Gym Buddy project, certain tasks did take a lot of trial and error, which made it so my actual time was way off from my estimated time. That was a bit disappointing, but inevitable in my opinion.

Overall, I’m beginning to understand the importance of effort estimation and tracking, but I’m nowhere near good enough at it in my opinion. This project and reflection allowed me to see where I really struggled during a tangible process, and has given me the opportunity to find new ways to grow and be a better programmer.
