### A Misleading Name
Originally, when I first heard of the phrase "design patterns", I thought more about code legibility. Certain classes I've taken throughout my CS career has stressed the importance of making sure your code is easy to read and understand, because when you work in a group on the same project, you want everything to be cohesive and easy to edit. In that way, design patterns are similar in that they are meant to ensure efficient functionality, but it's a lot more than putting comments on your code for humans to read.
