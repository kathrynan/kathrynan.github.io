## Make Things Pretty

Whenever the subject of UI comes up, I seem to be the only person who actually likes using frameworks such as HTML. It holds a special place in my heart, since it was one of the reasons why I became a computer science major in the first place. I was an exploratory business major taking the mandatory ICS101 class, and one of the last lessons was an introductory course on HTML and CSS. I remember having so much fun figuring out how to make the website more customizable, that I didn't care if I had to go in and fix infuriatingly minor errors in the end. So when ICS314 began to revisit similar concepts, I was absolutely thrilled.

The two weeks we learned UI frameworks was exciting. I have a somewhat skewed perspective on the HTML portion of the lesson, as I already knew a lot of the topics covered. I also ended up teaching the ICS101 HTML/CSS lesson myself the previous semester, so the information was very fresh and polished in my brain. So when I began to learn about Bootstrap, I was super excited. I thought I knew everything I could possibly do in HTML and CSS, but Bootstrap offers so much more in terms of layout and customization.


## Learning Bootstrap

I'm not as familiar and comfortable with Bootstrap as I am with normal HTML and CSS, but practicing with the different commands and trying to replicate other websites helped me become familiar with it very quickly. For my ICS314 class specifically, I don't think enough time was given to really practice with Bootstrap, especially since we often have timed exercises to test our skills, and because there's so much more in terms of customization, it's harder to keep track of everything and understand what everything does intuitively unlike HTML (which is a lot simpler in my opinion).

Overall, however, I had a lot of fun learning more about Bootstrap and it's really inspired me to continue learning more about UI development and the different frameworks out there. This is one of the lessons where I feel very inspired to continue learning more outside of the class, since it taps into a more creative side of coding that I particularly enjoy.
