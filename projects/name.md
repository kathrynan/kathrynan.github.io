Rusted Heart is a short RPG created by the Game Dev Club at the Univeristy of Hawai'i at Manoa's Spring 2024 game jam. The game follows a little robot who is on a quest to find a new heart for his sister, who is quickly losing function. The player can explore different maps and talk to multiple NPCs for advice, where they can either negotiate or fight their way to get what they want. If the player chooses to "fight", the player is thrown into a rhythm game sequence that they must complete successfully in order to gain the information they need. The game is a quick yet immersive experience, filled with different scenes and characters to make the world feel alive.

This game jam was one of the first I had ever participated in, and although the game isn't perfect it was such fun to make and learn the process of game development. I coded the title screen and helped with some of the art for the backgrounds. The people I worked with were all so talented and amazing, and the officers did such a good job at making sure the project was completed. Here is a short dialogue scene from the beginning of the game.

The scene opens up to the main character, a robot who we know as "Brother" with his robot sister and bus uncle at a run-down gas station. The player gets the chance to move around and interact with his surroundings.

Brother: "Sis, are you sure you want to come along? You know the stories Uncle has told us about the city, and it's not safe for you to be wandering around without a battery."

Sister: "Well... unless I get a replacement soon, I'm going to die anyway. We don't really have any other options."
  "And I don't want you to go alone. Besides, Uncle will be there to help us too."

Brother: "I just don't like that we don't even know where exactly in the city we're going..."

Sister: "I'm not afraid. We'll find the junkyard. I know we will."

Brother: "..."
  "You're right."
