Rusted Heart is a short RPG created by the Game Dev Club at the Univeristy of Hawai'i at Manoa's Spring 2024 game jam. The game follows a little robot who is on a quest to find a new heart for his sister, who is quickly losing function. The player can explore different maps and talk to multiple NPCs for advice, where they can either negotiate or fight their way to get what they want. If the player chooses to "fight", the player is thrown into a rhythm game sequence that they must complete successfully in order to gain the information they need. The game is a quick yet immersive experience, filled with different scenes and characters to make the world feel alive.

This game jam was one of the first I had ever participated in, and although the game isn't perfect it was such fun to make and learn the process of game development. I coded the title screen and helped with some of the art for the backgrounds. The people I worked with were all so talented and amazing, and the officers did such a good job at making sure the project was completed. Here is a short dialogue scene from the beginning of the game.

<hr>

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
